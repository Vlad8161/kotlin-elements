Kotlin Elements
-----------------
Kotlin Elements is an extension of a the Java Element and TypeMirror API to Kotlin. By parsing the `@kotlin.Metadata` annotations that are generated by the Kotlin compiler it is possible to recover the lost information of Kotlin features. This makes it possible for you to write annotation processors that can understand and take full advantage of Kotlin language features using the same annotation processing tools you are used to from Java. 


Kotlin Compile Testing
-----------------------

Also included is a compile-testing library for Kotlin that you can use to write unit tests for your annotation processors.

It can compile mixed source sets, run annotation processors, inherit the host project's classpath, cross-compile to a given JDK (different from the host project's one) and works with the jigsaw module system that was introduced with Java 9. 

While the annotation processing API is still work-in-progress, you can already get a pre-release of the compile-testing library via jitpack:

```Gradle
allprojects {
	repositories {
		//...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}

dependencies {
    //...
    implementation 'com.github.tschuchortdev:kotlin-elements:compile-testing-prerelease-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

Kotlin Elements
-----------------
Kotlin Elements is an extension of a the Java Element and TypeMirror API to Kotlin. By parsing the `@kotlin.Metadata` annotations that are generated by the Kotlin compiler it is possible to recover the lost information of Kotlin features. This makes it possible for you to write annotation processors that can understand and take full advantage of Kotlin language features using the same annotation processing tools you are used to from Java. 

It also includes a compile-testing library for Kotlin that can compile mixed source sets and run annotation processors to be able to write integration tests for your annotation processors.
